app.about.modal.body=Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's \
  standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.\
   It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. \
  It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop \
  publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
